# Composite Design Pattern ‚Äì Pok√©mon Team Optimizer

## üß† Purpose of the Project

This project aims to **implement and demonstrate the Composite Design Pattern** through a concrete and fun use case: optimizing Pok√©mon teams.

## üß© About the Composite Design Pattern

The **Composite Design Pattern** is used to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It is particularly useful when working with tree-like structures.

### ‚úÖ Pattern Requirements

- The application should be structured like a **tree hierarchy**.
- An **interface** must define the business logic, shared by both **composite** (complex objects) and **leaf** (simple objects) components.
- The interface should **not differentiate** between a component and a sub-component ‚Äî both should be processed in the same way.

## üïπÔ∏è Business Use Case

The application serves as an assistant for **Pok√©mon trainers** to **optimize their Pok√©mon teams**.

### üêæ Pok√©mon Data Model

In the Pok√©mon universe:

- A **Pok√©mon** has a **name**, a **type**, and can undergo one or more **evolutions**.
- A Pok√©mon has a set of **four combat capacities** (moves).
- During training:
  - A Pok√©mon may **evolve** into another Pok√©mon.
  - It may also **learn new capacities**.
  - If it already knows 4 moves, it must either:
    - **Forget** one to learn the new one, or
    - **Give up** on the new move.

### üìà Application Behavior

Users provide their **Pok√©mon list** to the application.

The application returns:

- **All possible types** each Pok√©mon could have (including past evolutions).
- **All capacities** the Pok√©mon can use or could have learned throughout its evolutionary line.

This logic forms a **composite structure** where:
- Each **evolution stage** is a node in the tree.
- The application traverses the tree to gather the full set of **types** and **capacities**.
